# Diabetes-Predictor
This project is a comprehensive Diabetes Prediction System that combines machine learning and web development to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The system uses a Random Forest Classifier, achieving an accuracy of 75%, to analyze user input and predict the risk of diabetes. The frontend of the application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend is powered by a RESTful API, which processes user data, interacts with the machine learning model, and returns predictions in real-time. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web technologies to create an accessible, end-to-end solution for diabetes risk assessment.
